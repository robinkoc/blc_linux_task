BLC-Linux Task


For the first part of the task I created a .txt file and  used it with vim with the name myfile.txt. It contains the result of thing wanted in the task.

For the second part of the first part of the task I created a file with the name whatsthecoms.txt. It contains the purpose of the commands asked as short explanations. I got help from web and man command.

In the linux advanced part I did what is asked and typed my results into the file linuxadvanced.txt again using vim. 

For the bash task I created a test_folder with 3 random txt files inside. I have 2 .sh files named section1.sh and section2.sh that does what is asked. 

I uploaded these files to a repository on my github account with screenshots of the webserver for the section2 and the mail I received for the section1.
