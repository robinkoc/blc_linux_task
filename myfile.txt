My Name is Robin Koç. I studied high school in Diyarbakır. 
For collage I first studied medicine at Hacettepe Medical Faculty till my second year.
On my second year I dropped the medicine and started studying computer engineering at Odtü. 
Now I am at my second half of the third year with  2 months of internship experience. 

I don't think I have that much experience to choose a favorite subject but I can say that I liked deterministic machines and their applications specifically. 
I loved the idea of finding and building a solution for the problem at hand with only the given tools and rules, like a puzzle.
 
My goals are not that high. 
A stress free and silent life.
